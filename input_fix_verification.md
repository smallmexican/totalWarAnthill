# Input Fix Verification Guide

## Summary of Recent Fixes

### ✅ Input Mapping Added to project.godot
- Added standard Godot input mappings for `ui_cancel` (ESC), `ui_accept` (ENTER/SPACE), and directional keys
- This was the primary issue preventing input from working in Strategic Map

### ✅ Enhanced Strategic Map Input Handling
- Added dual ESC key detection (both `ui_cancel` action and direct `KEY_ESCAPE` check)
- Added proper input handling with `get_viewport().set_input_as_handled()`
- Added clear debug output for all key presses
- Added `return` statements to prevent multiple handlers from firing

### ✅ Confirmed Pause Menu Functionality
- Resume button properly uses `queue_free()` to close overlay
- ESC key in pause menu calls resume function
- Settings and Main Menu buttons work correctly

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Game
```
"c:\Godot Games\Godot_v4.3-stable_mono_win64\Godot_v4.3-stable_mono_win64.exe" --path "c:\Godot Games\Godot_v4.3-stable_mono_win64\Game Projects\total-war-anthill"
```

### 2. Test Main Menu Navigation
- ✅ Click "Start Game" - should load Strategic Map
- ✅ Click "Settings" - should load Settings Menu
- ✅ Click "Quit" - should exit game

### 3. Test Strategic Map Input
**Expected Debug Output:**
- When pressing any key: `Key pressed: [keycode] ([character])`
- When pressing ESC: `ESC key detected (ui_cancel) - returning to main menu` OR `ESC key detected (direct) - returning to main menu`
- When pressing P: `P key detected - showing pause menu`
- When pressing C: `C key detected - entering colony view`

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Press **ESC** - should return to Main Menu
- ✅ Press **P** - should show Pause Menu overlay
- ✅ Press **C** - should transition to Colony View

### 4. Test Pause Menu (from Strategic Map)
1. From Strategic Map, press **P** to open Pause Menu
2. Verify the Strategic Map is still visible in background
3. Test Pause Menu options:
   - ✅ Press **ESC** - should resume game (close pause menu)
   - ✅ Click **Resume** - should resume game
   - ✅ Click **Settings** - should open Settings Menu
   - ✅ Click **Main Menu** - should return to Main Menu

### 5. Test Settings Menu
- ✅ Verify Settings Menu loads and displays placeholder content
- ✅ Click "Back" - should return to previous menu

## Debug Output to Look For

### Strategic Map Loading:
```
✅ Main scene manager found: Main
✅ show_pause_menu method exists
=== STRATEGIC MAP LOADED ===
This is a placeholder scene.
Controls:
  ESC - Return to Main Menu
  C - Enter Colony View
  P - Show Pause Menu
```

### Key Press Detection:
```
Key pressed: 80 (P)
P key detected - showing pause menu
```

### Pause Menu Loading:
```
=== PAUSE MENU LOADED ===
Game is paused. Use menu options to continue.
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "❌ show_pause_menu method NOT found!"
**Solution:** The Main.gd script may not be properly loaded. Restart Godot and try again.

### Issue: No key presses detected in Strategic Map
**Solution:** Check that the Strategic Map scene has focus and that the script is properly attached.

### Issue: ui_cancel action not recognized
**Solution:** This should now be fixed with the input mappings added to project.godot. If still occurring, check that the project was reloaded.

### Issue: Pause Menu doesn't appear
**Solution:** Check the console for error messages. Verify that PauseMenu.tscn exists and has the correct script attached.

## Files Modified in This Fix

1. **project.godot** - Added standard input mappings
2. **scripts/game/strategic_map.gd** - Enhanced input handling with dual ESC detection and proper event handling
3. This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. **Test all functionality** using the guide above
2. **Verify debug output** appears as expected
3. **Confirm smooth transitions** between all scenes
4. **Report any remaining issues** for further debugging

All critical input handling issues should now be resolved!
