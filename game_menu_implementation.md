# Game Menu Implementation - Complete Guide

## ✅ **NEW FEATURE**: In-Game Menu via ESC Key

I've implemented the requested in-game menu that appears when you press ESC during gameplay. This provides a much better user experience than directly going to the main menu.

## 🎯 **What's New**

### **New Game Menu** (`scenes/ui/GameMenu.tscn`)
A professional in-game menu with the following options:
- **Resume Game** - Return to gameplay
- **Save Game** - Save current progress (placeholder)
- **Load Game** - Load a saved game (placeholder)  
- **Settings** - Open settings menu
- **Main Menu** - Return to main menu
- **Quit Game** - Exit application

### **Enhanced Navigation System**
- Settings menu now properly returns to the correct calling menu
- Context-aware back navigation (different behavior when in-game vs main menu)
- Proper overlay system that preserves game state

## 🎮 **How It Works**

### **From Strategic Map:**
1. Press **ESC** → Shows Game Menu overlay
2. Strategic Map remains visible and paused in background
3. Choose from menu options:
   - **Resume** or **ESC** → Return to game
   - **Settings** → Open settings, can return to game menu
   - **Main Menu** → Go to main menu (clears game)
   - **Save/Load** → Placeholder functionality
   - **Quit** → Exit game

### **Settings Navigation:**
- **From Main Menu** → Settings → Back → Returns to Main Menu
- **From Game Menu** → Settings → Back → Returns to Game Menu
- Context automatically detected and handled

## 🔧 **Files Created/Modified**

### **New Files:**
1. `scenes/ui/GameMenu.tscn` - Game menu scene with professional layout
2. `scripts/ui/game_menu.gd` - Game menu logic and navigation

### **Modified Files:**
1. `scripts/Main.gd` - Added `show_game_menu()` and enhanced `show_settings_menu()`
2. `scripts/game/strategic_map.gd` - ESC now shows game menu instead of main menu
3. `scripts/ui/settings_menu.gd` - Context-aware back navigation
4. `scripts/main_menu.gd` - Uses new settings system

## 📋 **Testing Instructions**

### **Basic Game Menu Test:**
1. Start game from main menu
2. Wait for Strategic Map to load

### **Menu Navigation Test:**

2. Press **ESC** again, click **Settings** → Should open Settings
3. From Settings, click **Back** → Should return to Game Menu
4. From Game Menu, click **Main Menu** → Should go to Main Menu
