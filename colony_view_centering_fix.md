# Colony View Centering Fix - Test Guide

## Problem Identified
The Colony View was not properly centered when accessed through Main Menu ‚Üí Start Game ‚Üí Colony button, because:
1. ColonyView uses Control as root node
2. Control node was added to GameLayer (Node2D parent)
3. Control nodes need explicit sizing when added to Node2D parents
4. Anchors don't work the same way when Control is child of Node2D

## Solution Applied
**Dynamic Viewport Sizing in colony_view.gd:**
- Added `_setup_viewport_size()` method called via `call_deferred()`
- Gets viewport size and explicitly sets Control node size and position
- Ensures Control fills entire screen regardless of parent type

## Changes Made

### colony_view.gd Updates:
```gdscript
func _ready():
    # Setup viewport sizing after node is in scene tree
    call_deferred("_setup_viewport_size")
    
func _setup_viewport_size():
    var viewport_size = viewport.get_visible_rect().size
    set_size(viewport_size)
    set_position(Vector2.ZERO)
```

## Test Procedure

### Test 1: Through Main Menu (Should now be centered)
1. Run project (F5)
2. Main Menu ‚Üí Start Game 
3. Strategic Map ‚Üí Click "üè† Colony 1" button
4. **Colony View should now be fully centered** ‚úÖ
5. Check debug output for sizing information

### Test 2: Direct Scene Test (Should still work)
1. Run ColonyView.tscn directly from Godot editor
2. Should still be properly centered ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Button Functionality (Should still work)
1. All 4 buttons should be clickable and responsive ‚úÖ
2. Back button should return to Strategic Map ‚úÖ

## Expected Debug Output

```
=== COLONY VIEW LOADED ===
=== COLONY VIEW SIZING ===
Viewport size: (1152, 648)
Control size: (1152, 648)  
Control position: (0, 0)
Colony: Main Colony
Population: 50
Food: 100
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works:
- `call_deferred()` ensures sizing happens after node is fully in scene tree
- Explicit `set_size()` and `set_position()` override any layout issues
- Works regardless of whether parent is Control or Node2D
- Maintains all anchor-based child positioning within the Control

### Alternative Solutions Considered:
1. ‚ùå **Change to Node2D root** - Would break UI layout system
2. ‚ùå **Add wrapper Control in GameLayer** - Adds unnecessary complexity  
3. ‚úÖ **Dynamic sizing in script** - Clean, simple, reliable

## Root Cause
Control nodes with percentage-based anchors (anchors_preset = 15) expect their parent to provide size information. When added to Node2D parents, this size information isn't automatically provided, causing the Control to have zero or incorrect size.

This fix ensures the Control always gets proper viewport dimensions regardless of parent type.

**Result**: Colony View should now be perfectly centered with all buttons functional when accessed through the normal game flow!
